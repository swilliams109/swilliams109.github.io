<p>This topic helped me understand the importance of respecting creators’ rights by protecting intellectual property (IP), including copyrights, trademarks, and patents. I learned that illegal file sharing—like downloading or distributing copyrighted material without permission—violates IP laws and can lead to serious consequences, both legally and ethically. Through case studies and readings, I saw how these issues affect industries like music, film, software, and publishing. In both academic and professional settings, I’ll now be more conscious of using licensed or open-source materials properly, which not only ensures compliance with the law but also supports original creators.</p>
