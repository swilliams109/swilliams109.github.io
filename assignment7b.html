        Completing this assignment helped me understand how to interpret database table relationships and extract information without direct database querying. By analyzing tables and primary-foreign key connections, I learned to answer business questions from database schemas and sample data. This knowledge improves my ability to design efficient database queries and supports my future work in database management or application development. Understanding how different entities relate prepares me for writing SQL queries and database design tasks in professional environments.
