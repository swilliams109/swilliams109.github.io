Topic: Verifying Internet Connectivity Using Network Tools
In this session, I learned how to verify Internet connectivity through a variety of troubleshooting steps and tools available on different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The process starts with checking for a physical connection. For wired connections, I learned to confirm that connectivity lights are active on the network adapter and the router or switch. For wireless connections, I reviewed how to confirm network status through system settings or network utilities. Once physical connectivity is verified, the next step is to check IP address settings.
On Windows, I used the `ipconfig` command to view my IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. For macOS and Linux systems, I learned to use `ifconfig` or review settings in System Preferences or networking utilities. One of the most valuable tools was the `ping` command, which helps determine if a device can communicate with another host. I practiced pinging my local IP address, the default gateway, and a remote address like 8.8.8.8 (Google’s DNS server). I also used `tracert` (or traceroute) to see the path data takes from my computer to a remote host, which helps identify where connection issues may be occurring. Finally, I used `nslookup` to verify DNS functionality by resolving domain names into IP addresses.
This knowledge is especially useful for troubleshooting slow or dropped connections, whether at home or in a work environment. I now know how to identify whether an issue is caused by the local machine, the router, the ISP, or a DNS server. In the future, these tools will help me quickly diagnose and potentially resolve connectivity issues without needing to wait for IT support. This hands-on learning has made me more confident in managing and maintaining reliable internet access.
Topic: File Sharing, OS Licensing, Internet Plans, and Home Network Setup
This session focused on learning how to share folders across devices using different operating systems, compare OS licensing and support costs, evaluate internet service providers, and understand the components of a home network setup. I began by exploring how to share folders on Windows using both the graphical interface and command-line tools. With the GUI, I right-clicked a folder, selected "Properties," enabled sharing, and set permissions. From another Windows machine, I accessed the shared folder using the UNC path (e.g., `\\ComputerName\SharedFolder`). I also practiced using the `net share` and `net use` commands to create and connect to shared folders via the command line. On macOS, I enabled File Sharing through System Preferences and connected using the “Connect to Server” option. For Linux, I reviewed how to use Samba to share folders and access Windows shares through file manager or terminal.
I also researched license and support costs. Windows often has a one time or subscription license fee, with varying support tiers. macOS is included with Apple hardware, offering built-in support, while Linux is free and open-source, with optional paid support available from vendors like Red Hat.
In comparing Internet providers, I looked into cable, DSL, fiber, satellite, and cellular services. Cable and fiber offer high bandwidth and low latency but limited mobility. Satellite and cellular are more mobile but less reliable due to weather and signal range. Security, concurrent device support, and pricing vary widely.
Finally, I learned that a basic home network requires a modem, router, Ethernet cables, and optional switches or Wi-Fi extenders. Applying this knowledge, I can now set up a home network, choose the best internet provider for my needs, share files securely between devices, and make cost-effective OS decisions for personal or small business use.
