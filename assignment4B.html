Topic: Using Anti Malware Software to Scan and Test Malware Detection
This session focused on understanding and using anti-malware software to scan a computer system and test its ability to detect malicious files using a safe method. I began by reviewing a comparison of antivirus software on Wikipedia, which helped me evaluate options based on detection rates, system impact, ease of use, and update frequency. I chose a reputable, free anti-malware program—Malwarebytes—for this activity. After downloading and installing it, I ran a full system scan. The software analyzed files, memory, startup items, and running processes, and fortunately, it did not detect any threats on my device.
Next, I learned about the EICAR test file, a harmless text file developed to safely test anti virus software responses. The EICAR file mimics malware behavior without being dangerous. I downloaded the EICAR file from a trusted source and saved it to my desktop. Immediately, my anti malware software detected and quarantined the file, alerting me that it had found a potential threat. This confirmed that my anti-malware program was functioning correctly and actively monitoring my system.
This experience taught me how anti malware software operates and how to confirm it is working properly. It emphasized the importance of not only installing security software but also regularly updating and testing it to ensure protection against new threats.
In my current and future environments, especially when handling personal or sensitive work data, I will use what I learned to maintain a safe digital space. Running regular scans, avoiding suspicious downloads, and verifying antivirus functionality can help prevent data loss, identity theft, or system compromise. Knowing how to safely test my defenses with tools like the EICAR file gives me confidence that my systems are secure and ready to detect real threats when they arise.
Topic: Practicing Web Browser Safety
This session focused on practicing web browser safety by reviewing privacy and security settings, managing add ons, clearing personal data, and using private browsing. I started by exploring the privacy settings in popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. In Chrome, I reviewed Google’s privacy settings to manage cookies, permissions, and tracking. In Firefox, I used the Privacy & Security panel to enable Enhanced Tracking Protection and set custom cookie preferences. Safari allowed me to manage website data and control which websites could use my location, camera, and microphone.
One of the first tasks was to check the browser version to ensure it was up to date, as updates often contain critical security patches. I also reviewed and removed unnecessary browser extensions or add-ons, as outdated or untrusted ones can create security vulnerabilities. Next, I cleared the browser cache, cookies, and browsing history, which helps protect privacy and ensures old data doesn’t affect performance. I also examined autoform settings and removed any saved personal information like credit card numbers or addresses that I didn’t want stored in the browser.
I visited a secure website ([https://en.wikiversity.org](https://en.wikiversity.org)) and clicked the padlock icon to view its SSL certificate, verifying that the site was using HTTPS and issued by a trusted authority. This step confirmed the website’s identity and ensured encrypted communication. Lastly, I used incognito/private browsing mode to access a website that normally remembers me. It was eye-opening to see how the website treated me as a new user—no saved logins, no personalized ads—demonstrating the effectiveness of private browsing for enhanced privacy.
This knowledge is highly useful for protecting personal information, especially when using shared or public computers. In my current and future environments, I can apply these practices to browse safely, maintain digital hygiene, and reduce the risk of data breaches or identity theft.
